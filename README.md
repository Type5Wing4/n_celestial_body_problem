# N-celestial-body simulation
N-celestial-body problems are solved numerically.
Once initial conditions of bodies, their positions and velocities at start time, is determined, the trajectories of them also determined according to Newton's law.
In general when the number of bodies N >= 3, it is impossible to solve the diffrerential equation analytically, and therefore we rely on numerical approximation methods.

The codes are only for teaching.
Multiple methods will be selected and compared, and please learn programming and calculation errors.
